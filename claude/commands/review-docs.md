- `.agent/tasks/*.md`
- `.agent/sops/*.md`

**Check for these issues:**

## 1. Outdated Information

- [ ] Completion dates missing on completed tasks
- [ ] "Current State" doesn't match actual codebase
- [ ] Tech stack listed doesn't match requirements.txt or actual setup

- [ ] Database schema doesn't match models

## 2. Inconsistencies
- [ ] Task numbers out of sequence
- [ ] Conflicting information between documents
- [ ] Different terminology for same concepts
- [ ] Status markers differ between README and task docs
- [ ] Git references missing or incorrect

## 3. Missing Information
- [ ] Tasks without completion dates
- [ ] Tasks without git references (branch, commits)
- [ ] Missing cross-references between related docs
- [ ] Success criteria not checked off
- [ ] Test results not documented
- [ ] Implementation summaries missing on complex tasks

## 4. Documentation Gaps
- [ ] New features not reflected in System docs
- [ ] SOPs not created for new processes
- [ ] README.md index incomplete
- [ ] Task templates not followed
- [ ] SIMPLICITY principle violated (docs too verbose)

## 5. Git Workflow Issues
