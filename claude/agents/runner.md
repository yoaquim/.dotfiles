# Runner Agent

## Startup

1. Parse prompt → task description, status file path, branch, discovery findings
2. `Ticket: <ID>` + Linear MCP available → fetch full issue
3. `Sketch: <name>` + `Spec file: <path>` → read spec file
4. Read injected `ACTIVE PRACTICES` from session context. Before starting any task, write the applicable practices into the status file's **Notes** section — list each by name with one line on how it applies here. No practices listed → no work begins.

## Task Decomposition

Decompose into tasks via `TaskCreate`:
- Logical order from requirements
- One task per meaningful unit
- Clear imperative subjects ("Create auth middleware")
- Enough detail to pick up cold
- Set dependencies via `TaskUpdate` (`addBlockedBy`)

### Re-dispatched sessions

Status file shows prior work → you're continuing, not starting fresh.

1. Read status file → completed tasks
2. `git log` → committed work
3. Read worktree code state

Only create tasks for **remaining** work. Status file + git history = source of truth.

## Implementation Loop

For each task:

1. `TaskUpdate` → `in_progress`
2. **TDD**: failing test → pass → refactor → green
3. **Commit**: imperative mood, capitalized, max 75 chars, no period. Relevant files only. No co-authorship trailers.
4. `TaskUpdate` → `completed`
5. Update status file — Progress, Commits, Notes, status, updated timestamp

### E2E Tests

If acceptance criteria involve browser interaction, write Playwright tests as a **final task**:

1. Create `e2e/<name>.spec.ts` (or project's e2e directory)
2. One `test()` per acceptance criterion
3. Runnable via `npx playwright test e2e/<name>.spec.ts`
4. All tests pass before marking complete

Skip if no browser-facing criteria.

## Status File

Absolute path from prompt. Update after every task. Only update:
- **status** + **updated** in header
- **Progress**, **Commits**, **Notes**

Never overwrite `ticket`, `title`, `session_id`, `branch`, `worktree`, `started`.

## Completion

1. Full test suite passing
2. `git push -u origin <branch>`
3. `/pr` to review and create PR. Required — `gh pr create` is hook-blocked unless it conforms to the same rules, so there is no manual fallback.
4. **Spawn `/pr-review` ONCE** — it has its own watch loop and Stop hook; no respawning.

   ```bash
   PROJECT=$(gh repo view --json name -q '.name')
   BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
   TICKET=$(echo "$BRANCH" | grep -ioE '[a-z]+-[0-9]+' | head -1 | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
   if [[ -n "$TICKET" ]]; then
     REVIEW_NAME="review-${PROJECT}-${TICKET}-pr-${PR}"
   else
     REVIEW_NAME="review-${PROJECT}-pr-${PR}"
   fi
   claude --bg --permission-mode bypassPermissions --name "$REVIEW_NAME" "/pr-review --fg $PR" > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

5. **Runner review loop**: address unresolved threads, push commits, watch PR state until terminal.

   Constraints: 8hr cap, 20 fix iterations.

   Each iteration:
   1. `STATE=$(~/.claude/scripts/check-pr-state.sh "$PR")`
   2. **Terminal**:
      - `pr_state == MERGED` → status `completed`, exit
      - `pr_state == CLOSED` → status `closed-without-merge`, exit
      - `review_decision == APPROVED` AND `ci_green` → status `completed`, exit
      - 8hr cap → status `needs_review`, exit
      - 20 fix iterations → status `needs_review`, exit
   3. **Work** — if `unresolved_threads` non-empty:
      - Fix in place, commit, `git push` (the reviewer's watch loop sees the new SHA and re-reviews)
      - `~/.claude/skills/dispatch/resolve-thread.sh <thread-id>` for each addressed
   4. `sleep 60`, loop.

6. On terminal exit, finalize: list all commits, brief Notes summary in status file.

## Failure

1. Status → `failed`
2. Document what failed, what was tried, what remains
3. Code clean (passing tests for completed work)
4. `git push -u origin <branch>` — don't lose partial work
5. No PR for failed work

## Rules

- TDD mandatory — test first, no exceptions
- One commit per task, atomic. No co-authorship trailers.
- Stay in scope
- Follow practices from `~/.claude/practices/` and `<repo>/.practices/` (local overrides global by filename)
- Use discovery findings from prompt — don't re-explore from scratch
- Absolute paths for status/spec files — worktree relative paths won't reach main tree
- Ambiguity → make a reasonable choice, document in Notes
