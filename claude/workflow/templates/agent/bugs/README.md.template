This directory contains bugs that are not tied to a specific feature.

## Bug Tracking

Bugs can be:
1. **Feature-tied**: Stored in `.agent/features/NNN-name/bugs/` - tied to a specific feature
2. **Standalone**: Stored in `.agent/bugs/` - general bugs not tied to any feature

Use `/bug` to create bug documentation:
- `/bug 001` - Bug tied to feature 001
- `/bug` - Standalone bug (stored here)
