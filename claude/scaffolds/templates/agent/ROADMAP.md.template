## Linking to Features

When a roadmap item becomes a feature:

1. Create feature with `/feature <description>`
2. Update the roadmap item status to "Defined"
3. Add feature reference: `→ Feature 001`

Example:
```
| 001 | User Auth | Login/logout flow | Defined → Feature 001 |
```

## Updating This Roadmap

Use `/roadmap` to update this document with new ideas, reorganize phases, or capture brain dumps.

The command will:
- Parse unstructured input into structured items
- Assign sequential IDs (001, 002, 003...)
- Suggest phase assignments
- Update status as items progress
