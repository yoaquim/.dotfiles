# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Documentation

This directory contains all critical documentation for the project.

## Quick Links

### System Documentation
- [Overview](./system/overview.md) - Project goals, context, and technology stack
- [Architecture](./system/architecture.md) - Technical architecture and design decisions

### Tasks & Features
- [000 - Initial Setup](./tasks/000-initial-setup.md) - ✅ Project scaffolded
- [Task Template](./task-template.md) - Template for creating new task documents

### Feature Requirements
- Features defined in `./features/NNN-feature-name/README.md`
- Use `/feature <description>` to define new features

### Standard Operating Procedures

**Universal SOPs** (apply to all projects):
See `~/.claude/scaffolds/sops/` for universal procedures:
- [Git Workflow](~/.claude/scaffolds/sops/git-workflow.md)
- [Testing Principles](~/.claude/scaffolds/sops/testing-principles.md)
- [Documentation Standards](~/.claude/scaffolds/sops/documentation-standards.md)

**Project-Specific SOPs**:
See `./sops/` for this project's procedures:
- [{{FRAMEWORK}} Setup](./sops/{{FRAMEWORK_LOWER}}-setup.md)

### Known Issues & Troubleshooting
- [Known Issues Index](./known-issues/README.md) - Documented bugs, gotchas, and troubleshooting guides

## Documentation Structure

### `/tasks`
PRDs and implementation plans for features:
- Numbered sequentially (000, 001, 002, etc.) - 3 digits
- Each contains Problem, Solution, and Implementation Plan
- Track progress and decisions made

### `/system`
Current state documentation covering:
- Project structure and goals
- Technology stack and integration points
- Architecture and design

### `/sops`
**Two Types**:

1. **Universal** (in `~/.claude/scaffolds/sops/`) - Referenced, not copied
   - Git workflow
   - Testing principles
   - Documentation standards

2. **Project-Specific** (in `./sops/`) - Copied from templates
   - Framework-specific setup
   - Deployment procedures
   - Local development workflows

### `/known-issues`
Troubleshooting knowledge base:
- Documented bugs and their fixes
- Non-obvious gotchas and edge cases
- Lessons learned from debugging
- Prevention tips for common pitfalls
- Numbered sequentially (01, 02, 03, etc.) - 2 digits
- Searchable across all projects in `~/Projects`

## Naming Conventions

All directories and files use lowercase, kebab-case naming:
- Directories: `tasks/`, `known-issues/`, `sops/`
- Files: `git-workflow.md`, `user-authentication.md`
- Tasks: `000-initial-setup.md`, `001-feature-name.md`
- Issues: `01-issue-name.md`, `02-another-issue.md`

## Guiding Principles

**SIMPLICITY FIRST**: This project prioritizes simplicity above all else. If documentation becomes too verbose, break it down into smaller, focused documents.

## Maintenance

Keep this documentation updated after implementing features to ensure it reflects the current state of the system.

**After Every Feature**:
1. Update task document (mark complete, add summary)
2. Update system docs (if architecture changed)
3. Update SOPs (if new processes introduced)
4. Update this README (task status in index)
